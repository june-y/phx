##Implementation
     I would say on the first day and second day, I spent a lot of time trying to really understand contexts. Eventually I figured I should move onto produced code and followed along with tutorials.

     Missing Implementation: I originally wanted to make it so that you could sort the table by date for orders. If the order had the same date as 'today' the column would be highlighted. Spent some time trying to implement that with no success.

##Tasks
    I would create an actual login mechanism (username and password). I would also create a context so that I could have user types; Pharmacy, internal and courier would then be limited by actual user permissions. As it is the web app is 'open' to everyone, but the backend is set up to perform more of the tasks needed for managing orders,pharmacies and couriers.

##Project Changes
    I don't think the project is uninteresting. You could offer a variation on what the goals of the courier/pharmacy are. Is it to provide as many prescription in a day? Is it to predict when a pharmacy needs more stock for orders? Is it to compare prices that are cheaper for the user, but potentially the courier goes farther and that also increases cost. Aligning orders by distance so that couriers can plan a more linear route?
